Benchmarks for DyNet
--------------------

**Note:** dynet-cpp needs the vanila_lstm branch of DyNet to compile.

Current goal is to have
* rnnlm
* rnnlm-batch
* treelstm
* bilstm-tagger
* bilstm-tagger-withchar (Character embeddings)

in DyNet and Chainer, and

* rnnlm
* rnnlm-minibatch
* bilstm-tagger

in Theano and TensorFlow
